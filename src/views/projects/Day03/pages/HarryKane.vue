  <p>
    Harry Edward Kane (born 28 July 1993) is an English professional footballer
    who plays as a striker for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich and captains the
    England national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers of
    his generation and one of the greatest players in Premier League
    history,[2][3][4][5][6] he is both Tottenham Hotspur's and England's
    all-time highest goalscorer, as well as being the second-highest all-time
    goalscorer in the Premier League.[7] Kane has scored over 400 career goals
    for club and country.[8] Beginning his senior career with Tottenham Hotspur
    in 2009, Kane had loan spells out to clubs across the English football
    pyramid, including Leyton Orient, Millwall, Leicester City, and Norwich
    City. Kane's involvement at Tottenham increased after Mauricio Pochettino
    became head coach in 2014, and in his first full season at the club he was
    named PFA Young Player of the Year. In the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons, Kane
    finished as the league's top goalscorer. In the latter campaign, he helped
    Tottenham finish as Premier League runners-up and was named PFA Fans' Player
    of the Year. Kane registered his best campaign statistically to date in the
    2017–18 season, with 41 goals scored in 48 games across all competitions,
    and in the following season, he finished as a runner-up in the UEFA
    Champions League. He ended the 2020–21 season as the league's top goalscorer
    and top assist provider.

    In 2023, Kane became the most expensive signing in Bundesliga history,
    costing €110 million, as he signed for Bayern Munich. In his debut season,
    he scored 36 league goals, clinching a first European Golden Shoe. Kane has
    scored 71 goals in 105 appearances for England. He appeared more than 30
    times at youth international level and made a goalscoring debut with the
    senior team in March 2015, at age 21. Kane featured and scored during
    England's successful UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, and represented the
    country at the tournament. He was named England captain just before the 2018
    FIFA World Cup, in which he finished as the competition's top goalscorer,
    winning the Golden Boot, leading England to fourth place, their highest
    finish since 1990. He led England to the runner-up position at UEFA Euro
    2020, marking their first appearance in a final at the tournament and their
    first major final since 1966. At Euro 2024, Kane finished as the
    tournament's joint-top scorer as he again captained England to the final.
